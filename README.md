# Senior-Year-Project (2017)

Portable Surveillance and Network Monitoring System with a Web Interface.

Senior Year Project where I had an idea of biulding a system that both the non technicals and technicals users can use, something small, portable and user friendly.

The components used to create this system was a raspberry pi B+, Logitech camera, power bank and 2 wifi usb cards ( Alpha Network AWUS036H and USB 802.11n).

The whole system interacts with a tool known as NZYME: (https://wtf.horse/2017/10/02/introducing-nzyme-wifi-802-11-frame-recording-and-forensics/) a  WiFi Monitoring, Intrusion Detection And Forensics and a GRAYLOG webserver: (https://www.graylog.org/) Documentation: (http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/). I would want to give my credits to Lennart Koopmann for the amaizing tool and how he assited me in setting up his tool.
All the softwares I used are open source kindly do enjoy.
 
In this repository you will find the documentation which is vague and incomplete but it contains all the necessary parts on how the system works, I have also included the Web Interface files you can upload them in a webhost or xammp/lamp/wamp server but you will be forced to change some settings.

I will be working on a version two documentation and system upgrade in future BYE BYE Enjoy.
